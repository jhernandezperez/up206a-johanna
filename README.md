Hello! I am Johanna, a third-year doctoral student from the Sociology department. I am very interested in this course, as I expect to integrate spacial data methods to my dissertation proposal. My project looks at state's role in developing tourism. I am interested in understanding the implications of tourist area development (how other areas become affected and how populations become displaced). While my MA looked at the narratives government created to promote tourism internationally, I would like to integrate the actual consequences of tourism within countries. My objective for this course is to become familiarized with the research possibilities that spacial data science provides--from learning the basics of Python, to finding data, to conducting analyses of it.
