#**Update on Project (Solo)**

My proposal is tentatively titled [Tourism Gentrification: The Case of Santurce, Puerto Rico](https://github.com/jhernandezperez/up206a-johanna/tree/main/proposal). 

As of now, I have just made my first maps with census data and I am currently exploring different datasets recommended by Yoh (use blockgroups instead of census tracks, consider using disaster data, and work on different years.

I think this week was quite productive since I was able to finally work on some maps (visualize what I have) and start thinking of other ways of getting to what I am interested in. Overall, what is not working right away is the pulling from Jupyter to Github. For that, I will email Ben tomorrow and see how we can fix it. 

As far as data, I will keep working with the Census. I am also trying to access GIS data from Puerto Rico's government on the amount of hotels. I've been unable to download it. For that, I have emailed the information contact on the page and see how it could be accessed. 

Other than the mentioned issues, that's where I am at!
