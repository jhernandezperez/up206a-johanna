# So far, I have been looking at these two datasets from the census to look into tourism and tourism development. Both these datasets are part of the census.
# The first one includes businesses in island areas in the US (including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Mariana Islands and US Virgin Islands, 2017). This would be a good opportunity to consider a variety of tourism businessess and compare among territories.Link to source: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=hotel%20and%20accomodations&g=0400000US72&n=53211
#The second one looks at accommodation and food services for Hawaii in 2012. Originally, I wanted to have the data for Puerto Rico and Hawaii to compare, but there does not seem to be an available dataset for PR.
