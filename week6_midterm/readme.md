# Revised Proposal: Tourism Gentrification: The Case of Santurce, Puerto Rico
*Most of my revisions are on the Description of Data Sources.*

   Santurce—the most populated barrio of San Juan, Puerto Rico— has transformed significantly in the past couple of decades. It has gone from being home to low-income communities to be “enjoying a “renaissance,” including an influx of new restaurants, shops, galleries, museums, and more” (Marrero 2016, 2; “Exploring the Santurce Neighborhood,” n.d.). These demographical and spatial changes have coincided with an increase in tourists visiting Puerto Rico even amid a 15-year economic recession, the aftermath of destructive, category-five Hurricane María, and the COVID-19 pandemic, with Puerto Rico positioning itself within the top 10% of US destinations (Landi Fontana, 2021). In light of this, I ask, what are the intersections between processes of gentrification and tourism?

Gentrification—that is, the displacement of lower-income residents as rental and property costs increase and an influx of capital and new, higher-income residents move in (Altaweel, 2016)— is often accompanied by narratives of revival and rebirth. Often, these narratives highlight the benefits of these transformations, like upscale stores, cleaner streets, and safer neighborhoods. Similarly, disaster tourism rhetorics used by tourist agents like the state narrate places as being rebuilt and “reborn,” making them desirable by tourists (Tucker et al., 2017). Because of these intersections, I propose to explore the following research question: _What are the relationships between gentrification and tourism processes between 2009 and 2019 at the census tract level in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico?_

## Relevance of the Project
Theorists traditionally think of tourism and gentrification as processes that coexist rather than feed off each other. Nevertheless, the case of Santurce might support the latter. By providing a case study of tourism increase in a zone that was not planned as a tourist space (vis-à-vis other areas of the Puerto Rican capital, like Old San Juan or Condado), this exploratory project might help map the overlapping of gentrification and tourism. More specifically, I seek to provide empirical proof to the theory that “the attraction of visitors accelerates the pressure of gentrification,” thus evidencing the intersections of both processes (Agustín-Cola 2018, 281).

## Spatial Scope 
My spatial scope consists of Santurce, Puerto Rico. Santurce is a barrio of San Juan, which has a subdivision of 40 subbarrios, including some that have seen an increase in tourism like Loíza and Ocean Park. Santurce was not planned as a tourist area. Tourism bureaucrats in the 1950’s rarely, if ever, mentioned the barrio in its developmental plans and instead emphasized remodeling areas of Old San Juan to promote the Spanish cultural heritage of Puerto Rico and Condado for beachfront hotels (see Hernández-Pérez, 2020). Santurce was historically known as the home of many urban poor. Within the barrio, one could find El Fanguito, a sector made known in the 1950s as one of the poorest slums of the US. Despite its history, new attractions have come to Santurce, including buildings adorned by murals in old and abandoned buildings (usually promoted by art events like Santurce es Ley), new food spots (like Lote 23), and nightlife (like that of La Placita). 

I believe the transformation of Santurce could be captured in a 10-year window, taking 2009 as my starting point and 2019 as an ending point. Those ten years encapsulate Puerto Rico’s recession and the aftermath of Hurricane María, which one would expect to impoverish communities and discourage leisure travel to the zone. However, what is reported is the opposite. Mapping these transformations can shed light on tourism gentrification.  

## Description of Data Sources
I have been using the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 2019 for this project. The ACS 5-year estimates are based on household surveys conducted on an ongoing basis. While I started working with census tracts, I have moved now to blockgroups and hope to move to barrios. 

There are various indicators of gentrification commonly used, race and ethnicity being one. However, racial and ethnic composition is a little tricky in PR, as the Census race categories do not fit with Puerto Ricans ’ understandings about their race (see Emigh et al., 2021). With this in mind, I have been using race looking primarily at the Hispanic/Latino vs. Non-Hispanic/Latino categories. With this, I expect to map where are US Americans clustering.  I also plan to use changes in rental markets, household income, and education (Bousquet 2017). I have started mapping household income, looking first at extremes (clusters of population with less than $10,000 on income vs. populations with incomes of over $200,000 or more). Ideally, I would like to create my own categories, merging some census categories and map below-poverty-threshold populations, working-class populations, middle-class income, and high-class income. 

Tourism seems to be a more elusive phenomenon, at least data-wise. However, I can use a few indicators, including population ratio to the number of hotels and motels, car rentals, full-service restaurants, and travel agencies (Hait 2017). Another source that could be used is geodata on hotels provided by the Government of Puerto Rico. I have been able to download this data as a shapefile and will start exploring it soon. 

Yoh has also brought to my attention Google Earth as a useful source to map barrios rather than block groups. I plan to conduct data exploration with these files and decide on a unit of analysis. 

## Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations
Using Santurce as my spatial scope, I aim to create various maps with hot spot analyses and geographically weighted regressions. I would run changes in each variable for the two periods (2009 and 2019). I would use the gentrification map (the one tracking the aforementioned gentrification indicators as the base layer) and the tourism map as the overlayer to see their relations. Since there are areas where tourism gentrification is more latent within Santurce, another possible path could be to do a subbarrio comparison.  

## Expected Insights
By overlaying tourism in the hypothesized gentrified areas, this project expects to shed light on the relationships between these two processes. I will support my maps with current reports and literature about gentrification and tourism. I believe this mapping will shed light on the spatial and demographic changes in Santurce.
